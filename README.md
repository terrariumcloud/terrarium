# Terrarium

Terrarium is an enterprise level Terraform Registry.

Based on a microservice architecture, it provides the ability to share modules and providers within a corporate network.
Terrarium is designed to enable support for the integration of your development and security processes and provides the ability to track module dependencies, such as container and machine images.  
With the use of [terrarium-lite](https://github.com/terrariumcloud/terrarium-lite) it allows teams to develop inside the corporate network and deploy outside.

Terrarium is Open Source and sponsored by [Synamedia](https://www.synamedia.com).
